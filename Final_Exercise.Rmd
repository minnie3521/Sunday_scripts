This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library("dplyr")

gap.in <- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", 
                     sep = "\t", 
                     header = TRUE)

gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Canada" | country == "Germany" | country == "China") %>%
  select(country, year, gdpPercap) ->data.out

summary(data.out)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Canada")->data.out.Canada

plot(x=data.out.Canada$year,y=data.out.Canada$gdpPercap,
     main = "Canada GDP vs Year",
     xlab="Year", ylab="gdpPercap",
     )
  

gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "Germany")->data.out.Germany

plot(x=data.out.Germany$year,y=data.out.Germany$gdpPercap,
     main = "Germany GDP vs Year",
     xlab="Year", ylab="gdpPercap"
     )

gap.in %>%
  filter(country == "China")->data.out.China

plot(x=data.out.China$year,y=data.out.China$gdpPercap,
     main = "China GDP vs Year",
     xlab="Year", ylab="gdpPercap"
     )
  
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gap.in %>%
  select(continent, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(min = min(lifeExp), mean = mean(lifeExp), max = max(lifeExp)) -> data.out.lifeExp
```
The mean life expectancy in Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania is `r 2 + 2`.
